    ELDAR stands for ELectronic Devices ARchive.
    It is a tool which implements a simplified version of a typical online archive provided by whatever electronic components distributor (e.g. DigiKey, RS-Components, Mouser, and so on...).
    Its intent is to facilitate the management of new and refurbished electronic devices recovered by unused PCBs.
    
    Available operations are:
        - storing new components;
        - deleting components out of stock;
        - editing existing components;
        - searching using multiple criteria (type, size, manufacturer, value, etc.) 

    Electronic devices currently supported:
        - resistors;
        - capacitors;
        - inductors

    Adopted technologies:
        - C++17
